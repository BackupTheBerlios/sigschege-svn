   - New project target
     Sigschege was planned as a batch tool to create timing diagrams. Since the creation of a timing 
     diagram is an interactive task and a batch tool has some usability problems with such a working
     flow, we decided to drop python and batch support in flavor of a nice GUI application.
   - Switch graphical framework
     In the past we were using WxWidget for some GUI example application. After searching around, 
     we decided to switch to QT.
   - New build system
     QT requires a build system that can call some special application. Autotools have no support
     for QT, so we switched to cmake which has build in support for QT, freetype and many more
     libraries.
