* Handle class: remove Object() function usage.
  Object() still necessary for pointer comparison?

* Event class: constructor with arguments, 
  absolutify function (remove reference but keep absolute time)

* TimList components (TimSignal, TimeMarker, ...)
  How to handle change of startTime, etc?
  a> components get current values when needed via callback 
     -> must actively watch for changes (on paint)
  b> all components get values by a common call
     -> deriving from same base class with polymorphism
        (LayoutObject does not seem appropriate)

* add label to time marker (time label and optional text label)

* Python interface: fix all those Py_INCREF's
