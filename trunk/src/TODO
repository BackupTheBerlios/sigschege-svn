* Handle class: remove Object() function usage.
  Object() still necessary for pointer comparison?

* Event class: constructor with arguments, 
  absolutify function (remove reference but keep absolute time)

* Derive TimLabel class from TimingObject
  => all TimList elements are derived from TimingObject, no need to query it

* Python interface: fix all those Py_INCREF's
